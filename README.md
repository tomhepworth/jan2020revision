#### Trees

FLOT: Lemma: The following are equivalent for an n-vertex graph T = (V , E):
 - (A) T is connected and has no cycles, i.e. is a tree;
 - (B) T has n − 1 edges and is connected;
 - (C) T has n − 1 edges and has no cycles;
 - (D) T has a unique path between any pair of vertices.

DFS Tree:
- Key Fact: if x and y are adjacent, then x is an ancestor of y or vice versa.

BFS Tree: 
- Key Fact: If {x, y} is an edge in G, then x and y cannot be more than one layer apart in T, i.e. |d(v, x) − d(v, y)| ≤ 1.

#### Euler Walk
- a graph has a closed Euler walk if and only if it is connected and each of its vertices has even degree; hence every vertex of G has even degree.
